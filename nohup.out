Solving for...
Brillouin zone: 2line
Number of k-points              = 800
Driving field direction         = 0
Driving amplitude (MV/cm)[a.u.] = (5.000000)[0.000972]
Pulse Frequency (THz)[a.u.]     = (370.995735)[0.008974]
Pulse Width (fs)[a.u.]          = (21.503130)[888.968930]
Chirp rate (THz)[a.u.]          = (0.000000)[0.000000]
Damping time (fs)[a.u.]         = (100.000000)[4134.137335]
Total time (fs)[a.u.]           = (9999.958069)[413412]
Time step (fs)[a.u.]            = (0.128355)[5.306360]
